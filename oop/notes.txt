OOP means object oriented programming and 
it is a programming style.

procedural : youre thinking on how to write the 
code from top to bottom by defining the variable and print them.

OOP: youre thinking in how to define into reusable components and
use it. (bottom up Approach).

THINKING IN OOP
everything on the world can be defined as an object .
start thinking and organise your code into smallercomponents
and real life objects.
stop thinking in procedural (variables and functions)
start thinking in objects

Class is a blueprint of an object.
class is a logical grouping of code with variables and functions
specific to that object.
    the main purpose of class is to organise your code into
    individual components.
identify how you can organise your code into objects.
example: Users,Data-base,Files,Post...etc.

then start grouping those into classes.
each class has variables and functions into related individual
objects

one class will hold many variabls and functions but it logically
represent that object.

classes help you to organise the variables and functions to
individual components

one class describe about one objects variables and functions.

ORGANIZE classes
first step is to identify classes in your program.

start defining the classes.

remember, classes are specifications are not real.

Variables inside the class are called as properties.

$name is a property of a class

Methods are the functions inside the class

properties help to define elements of a class, and Methods
helps to perform some action in that class.

Objects are used to access properties and Methodsof a class.
you need to create an object of a class and start accessing the
properties and call the methods of that class.
Objects are also called as Instance of a class.
you can create unlimited objects for a class.
each object properties are unique to that specific Instance of the class

the job of the user is to handle the user request and
the job of a database will be connecting to a database class

the users class can have two methods fetch users and delete users
